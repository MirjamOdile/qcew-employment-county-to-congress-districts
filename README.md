# qcew-employment-county-to-congress-districts
This script aggregates the Quarterly Census of Employment and Wages (QCEW) annual US county level employment data by industry (NAICS) to the Congressional district level for the 108th to 115th Congress (2003 - 2018) and adjusts for redistricting where Congress district boundaries have been changed outside the usual decennial rhythm.
