# This script loads and aggregates the Quarterly Census of Employment and Wages 
# (QCEW) annual US county level employment data by NAICS industry to the 
# Congressional district level for the 108th to 115th Congress (2003 - 2018).
# Data Source: CSVs By Industry - Annual Averages: 
# https://www.bls.gov/cew/downloadable-data-files.htm)
# 
# Specifically, the script
# (A) loads the county level annual average employment numbers for a specified 
#     range of years (in this example: 2003 to 2010) and industries classified
#     by NAICS industry codes (e.g. 10 Total, all industries; 21 Mining, 
#     quarrying, and oil and gas extraction; 211 Oil and gas extraction) ,
#     NAICS codes: 
#     https://www.bls.gov/cew/classifications/industry/industry-titles.htm
# (B) aggregates the data to the 108th Congress congressional district level 
#     with help of the Missouri Census Data Center Geographic Correspondence 
#     Engine Geocorr2000,
#     Source: https://mcdc.missouri.edu/applications/geocorr2000.html
# (C) and adjusts the data according to the resdistricting crosswalk files
#     provided by Autor, Dorn, Hanson and Majlesi (2020: Political Geography 
#     Crosswalk files G1, G2, G3 & G4).
#     Source: https://www.ddorn.net/data.htm
# 
# NOTE: To use this script, it is only neccessary to specify the correct 
#       information or to verify the output at the six steps that are marked
#       with "### >> Step X". All the remaining code should run automatically. 
# 
#-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


### >> Step 1: Specify the path to data parent directory ###
# 
# Set to the folder containing the data folders used in this script. The folder 
# should contain:
# 
# - One folder called QCEW that contains all the extracted zip files
#   "CSVs By Industry - Annual Averages" for each required year
#   (e.g. 2009.annual.by_industry, 2010.annual.by_industry). These can be
#   downloaded here:
#   https://www.bls.gov/cew/downloadable-data-files.htm
# 
# - One folder called geocorr2000 containing the county to 108th Congress 
#   districts crosswalk file geocorr2000_county_108cd.csv provided on github.
# 
# - One folder called PoliticalGeography that contains the Political Geography 
#   Crosswalk extracted G1, G2, G3 & G4 zip files (e.g. cw_cd108_cd109).
#   These can be downloaded here: https://www.ddorn.net/data.htm

#-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# (A) Load Quarterly Census of Employment and Wages (QCEW) annual US county 
#     level employment
#-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### >> Step 2: Specify path to QCEW data folder ###
# 
# Set to directory where the individual Annual Averages by Industry folders 
# are saved (absolute filepath or relative to working directory)
# 
directory = "QCEW/"
### <<

### >> Step 3: Define relevant years (between 2003 and 2018) ###
# 
years <- c(2003, 2004, 2005, 2006, 2007, 2008, 2009, 2010)
### <<

### >> Step 4: Define relevant industry NAICS codes ###
# 
# "NAICS is a 2- through 6-digit hierarchical classification system, 
# offering five levels of detail. Each digit in the code is part of a series 
# of progressively narrower categories, and the more digits in the code 
# signify greater classification detail. The first two digits designate the 
# economic sector, the third digit designates the subsector, the fourth 
# digit designates the industry group, the fifth digit designates the NAICS 
# industry, and the sixth digit designates the national industry."

# 
# See list of "QCEW Industry Codes and Titles (For NAICS Coded Data)":
# https://www.bls.gov/cew/classifications/industry/industry-titles.htm
# 
# NOTE: There have been changes to some of the NAICS industry codes, i.e. NAICS 
# code with 4 or more digits. This means multiple codes may be required to load
# the same industry. Make sure to provide ALL required codes for the years 
# specified. Step 4 will provide an extra check to make sure that data has been 
# loaded for all years. A hierarchy crosswalk file to check the codes for all 
# years can be downloaded as a csv file here:
# https://www.bls.gov/cew/classifications/industry/2017-naics-hierarchy-crosswalk.htm
